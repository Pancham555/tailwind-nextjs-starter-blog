## Today's summary

So basically, I learned about arrays today, and solved 2 `leetcode` problems

Here are the links to it:

1. [Squares of a sorted array](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/description/)

2. [Monotonic array](https://leetcode.com/problems/monotonic-array/description/)

These are very basic level of problems, but I struggled to do so. Yet at the end, I was able to do it with the help of the course that I took from udemy, obviously, not fully on my own, but atleast its a good step than doing nothing or just copying from the solutions tab, written by someone on `leetcode`..

Wish my luck ðŸ¤ž

Also, maybe in a few days, I might also write a blog about interview questions, so stay tuned for it âœŒ..
