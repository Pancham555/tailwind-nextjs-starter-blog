![MERN Stack](https://inzint.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Features-of-Mern-stack-development-services-You-Should-Know-1.png)

## Overview

So far, I know many technologies, but only use few of in real life, one of which is **MERN Stack**.
Till this date I've made numerous projects (and I have added a new MERN Stack project just now on the projects page), but never actually got the time to do an internship, but now is the time!

Which is why, starting from this month, I started applying for interships for remotely (cause there are no opportunities where I live); and found out that it's very difficult to get one, for remote jobs specifically, but it's much easier to get one offline/on site. Still, I didn't lose hope and started applying, and got 2-3, but they were either unpaid, or so less that it's not worth to waste my time there, and now I am stuck with not internship now!

## Any solutions!

Yes! As I told I got unpaid or the ones paying less than 1k inr a month, which is very less :(, so I will have to do those only,
which is why I am very skeptical for it, if it's actually worth it or not, cause I know, for that mere amount or no amount at all, the only thing I am getting is a mere experience certificate, which is technically worth peanuts.
Like imagine the value of an experience certificate of a company which can't even pay it's interns properly, how valuable it is in the real world!.

Technically, if you did internships without any pay, then the worth of your hardwork is literally 0.

Just think for a second, a company literally hired you for **FREE!**, and you even accepted it; literally it's one of the most **PATHETIC** moves ever!

Which means the worth of the work you did is also **ZERO!**

So, even after those pathetic certifications, why would someone want to hire you, if the worth of your work is zero.

Which is why, one should never do unpaid, or even very low paying internships!

## What's now!

Now, this was supposed to be an update blog, not an internship one ðŸ˜…, but still I made my update and my message clear!

Right now, I have done many assesments given by companies to assess and examine my capabilites,(didn't got seleted till now by any), but some of the projects during this time were so good that it's worth putting in my projects page, which is why I have added a recent assesment project there.

Here is the link of it's Github repository [https://github.com/Pancham555/banao-mern-task-2.git](https://github.com/Pancham555/banao-mern-task-2.git)

There, I have added a readme so that you can run it on localhost/production environment!

## Conclusion

I will continue to apply for internships, cause I am free now! and this is how I will increase my value in the industry and eventually getting a good job in the future!
