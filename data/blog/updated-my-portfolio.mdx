## Introduction

I already had my own portfolio website but the main problem was that my of it's UI actually consisted of dummy data. So today I just removed all the unnecessary blocks and data that were present there.

### My website

Now you can visit my portfolio website right now on [https://next-lynx.vercel.app](https://next-lynx.vercel.app). And yes, I don't have a paid domain right now, but whenever I will buy one, I will make sure that I update this blog and paste the new link here; until then, the above url is only my portfolio in the current scenario..

If you have any work regarding websites, whether it is `frontend` `backend` or any `database` related stuff, you'll can contact me through email at panchamb63@gmail.com. For more details, you'll can visit my [website](https://next-lynx.vercel.app).

Right now it is built with `tailwindcss` and `next-js` only, and maybe, I will add more stuff to it in the future, so stay tuned to it.

So until then, bbye ðŸ‘‹
