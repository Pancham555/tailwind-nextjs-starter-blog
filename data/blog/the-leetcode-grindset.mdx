## Overview

So from today onwards (2/06/2024), I started solving problems on leetcode to improve my problem solving skills, but I was barely (with a little cheating) was able to solve barely 2 problems and then I gave up.

- Now why is that?
- Is it because I lack problem solving skills?
- Is it because of my lack of programming skills?
- Or something different?

**Let's find out!**

### Reason

Just to keep to short and precise, let me tell you that there is simply not a simple answer.

- Yes, I might lack problem solving skills! But that's what _Maths_ is for
- Yes, I lack programming skills! But that's what _Google_ is for

But the main culprit behind is that I am too new to this type of problems..

In real world, developers don't often work on problem solving skills (I mean **Yes** they do, but not always). Instead, they work on real problems (which might require problem solving skills but not necessarily, because in many of the cases, the solution is very simple), which is why, I mostly focussed on building projects and never focussed on leetcode problems.

So, the key thing is to **practice as much as we can**, and that is what will make us a better _programmer_. This is the only mantra here.

### So, is it necessary to solve leetcode?

**Not necessarily!**

If you are aiming for startups, then the only thing that you will need is you _**Skills**_ and some _Good Projects_ to showcase in your _resume_. And **That's it**

But but but!

if you are aiming for reputed companies, then you might need to solve leetcode problems,

So

Based on this information, you decide, whether you need to solve leetcode of not..

But, it's is good practice to solve a few problems..

And that's what I am doing **Right Now!**

Also, you all might have recognised that I have also added a typescript tag. And you all might guess that I am solving leetcode in _Typescript_, and you would be absolutely right here!

Alright, that's it for today, I wish you all _best of luck_ for your coding journey üë©‚Äçüíª
