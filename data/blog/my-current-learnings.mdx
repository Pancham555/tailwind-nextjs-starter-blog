## Overview

Right now I've learned typescript, and mdx, just enough to make this blog work,
and for the past few days I'm building sample apps just enough so that I can build
more things in the future.

The best resource to my knowledge is [https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/).
The UI is nicely built and is suitable (for me atleast) to learn.
Point to be noted that one must learn basics to typescript before jumping into this.
You can learn typescript from their official docs here [https://www.typescriptlang.org/](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

For the MDX part, I've learned it myself, cause it's not so different from MarkDown,
with one key difference being that MDX can also run javascript and typscript and many
other languages like this:

```javascript
// Javasript code

const number1 = 5
const number2 = 10

const output = () => number1 + number2

console.log(output)
```

```python
# Python code

number1 = 5
number2 = 10

def function:
    number1+number2

print(function())
```

Similarly you can also run typescript, python and many other languages, and that is why
it has some major advantages over traditional MarkDown.

## Conclusion

That's all for today, and I will be back with another blog ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
