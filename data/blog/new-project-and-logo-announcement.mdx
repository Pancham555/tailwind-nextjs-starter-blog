Hope you'all would like it!

## Project Announcement!

Recently, I've build a chatbot (Yes, Now I'm one of those AI GUYS AS WELL).

### What's it's Tech Stack?

The frontend of it's UI is built with Next.js, Shadcn and tailwind css and for the backend it uses the Next.js api routes.

To talk to the llm it uses langchain and uses GROQ AI sdk, cause it's the only AI sdk that provides a generous free tier and several llm (mostly ollama models).

### How the app works?

So in the dashboard, you will find a few ways, through which you can fine tune the model to get your desired output like choosing your desired AI model, temperature, max tokens, context, role and the main input message itself...

The memory of the chatbot is stored in the frontend, so if you refresh the page, it's memory will be gone!

Hope you would find this project meaningful!

Oh, I just forgot to give you the link of the project, here it is
